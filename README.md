# Tantalum

A little thing that will replace all other little things in the little field of
natural languages. Well, yeah, you know.

Well, ok, so the thing is, well, I mean, so here is the thing: I want to play
with spoken words. I want to change the tempo of a spoken phrase, emphasize
a word, map between accents. I want a linguistic spectrometer to untangle
a recording into phonetic equations. I want to create new languages, randomly
generate them, randomly generate spoken phrases from them. I want to visualize
vowels in F1-vs-F2 space. Write a lexer for Chinese. Extract the modes from
speech, diff files. I want to do everything. I want photoshop for sound. Not
just sound, but grammar and phonetics. Parameterized models of language.

This all seems formless, I know. But I can see dimly the shape of the program
I want to create. I can see where it would be used. I can even see the path to
building it. I can disassemble it into manageable pieces. The pieces I can
further break down. I can see where to start: implementing algorithms. General
Generative grammars. Simple sound libraries. Inference of phonetic metrics from
sound files. Basically, start by building infrastructure. Implement algorithms
and IO. Build standalone modules. Then weave them together.

There is a lot of literature in the field. I will start by implementing really
simple things, just to get a feel for the data structures. Then I'll play with
developing my own techniques. Then I will read.

I'm not sure how far I will go with this. It will have to remain a third or
fourth priority. It may be awhile before I even code anything.

Yada yada yada ...
